8. Building connections with people working in IT companies and participating in hackathons can help in getting recommendations and job opportunities.

9. Confidence in your skills and knowledge is crucial for clearing interviews and getting your first job as a python developer.

1. Understanding Python's data types is crucial for data manipulation and analysis, which are core tasks in data science.

2. Familiarity with data types like integers, floats, strings, and booleans helps in efficiently handling and processing data.

3. Knowing how to use complex data types such as lists, tuples, and dictionaries is essential for organizing and managing datasets.

1. Jupyter notebooks allow you to combine text documentation and code, making it ideal for constructing a narrative around data analysis.

2. Jupyter notebooks are commonly used by data scientists for data analysis in the real world.

3. To work with Jupyter notebooks in VS Code, you need to install the Python extension, which provides support for Jupyter notebooks.

4. Jupyter notebooks consist of cells, which can be either text or code cells.

5. Cells can be evaluated using the green play button, and the output is displayed below the cell.

6. Markdown cells allow you to add formatted text documentation using Markdown syntax.

7. Code cells allow you to write and execute Python code.

8. Keyboard shortcuts, such as Ctrl+Enter and Shift+Enter, can be used to evaluate cells and move between cells.

9. When working with Jupyter notebooks, it's important to rerun the entire file when reopening it to ensure all cells are evaluated in the correct order.

10. The last expression of a cell is automatically printed by default, allowing for easy display of results.

    1. Python uses indentation to structure code, making it important to use consistent and correct indentation.

2. Indentation is used to define blocks of code, such as loops and conditional statements.

3. Incorrect indentation can lead to syntax errors and cause the code to not run properly.

4. Python uses a colon (:) to indicate the start of an indented block.

5. It is recommended to use four spaces for each level of indentation.

6. Indentation can be done using spaces or tabs, but it is important to be consistent throughout the code.

7. Python does not use curly braces ({}) or semicolons (;) to define blocks of code like some other programming languages.

8. Proper indentation improves code readability and makes it easier to understand and maintain.

9. Python's indentation-based structure helps enforce clean and organized code.

10. Understanding and correctly using indentation is essential for writing effective Python code.

    1. Python scripts can be executed using the command prompt.

2. Create a Python script by using a text editor and save it with a .py extension.

3. Use the command prompt to navigate to the directory where the script is saved.

4. Use the Python interpreter to execute the script by typing "python" followed by the script name.

5. The output of the script can be redirected to a text file using the ">" symbol followed by the desired file name.

6. Stream redirection automatically creates a new text file if it doesn't exist or replaces the contents of an existing file.

7. Running Python scripts in the command prompt allows for easy execution and testing of code.
   1. Variables in Python are containers where you can store values.

2. Variables can be used to store numbers, strings, and other data types.

3. You can assign a value to a variable using the assignment operator (=).

4. Variables can be changed and updated with new values.

5. You don't need to define the type of a variable in Python, it is automatically determined based on the value assigned to it.

6. Using an undefined variable will result in a NameError.

7. Underscore (_) can be used to access the output of the previous operation.

8. Variables can be used with strings to store and manipulate text.
   1. In Python, the special variable "__name__" is used to determine if a module is being run as the main program or if it is being imported as a module.

2. When a module is run as the main program, the value of "__name__" is set to "__main__".

3. When a module is imported as a module, the value of "__name__" is set to the name of the module.

4. The "__name__" variable is useful when you want to execute certain code only when the module is run as the main program.

5. By checking the value of "__name__" and using an "if" statement, you can control which code is executed based on whether the module is run as the main program or imported as a module.
